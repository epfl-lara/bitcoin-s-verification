\label{chap:abstract}


In this thesis some experiments with formal verification are performed and examined. 
To this end, parts of the implementation of the Bitcoin protocol in Bitcoin-S are verified for correctness using the verification framework Stainless.

In the first part the goal of the work is stated. 
A brief overview of the main blocks of the study is given: concepts of formal verification, the verification framework Stainless and the Scala implementation of the Bitcoin protocol.

Chapter 2 outlines the first practical steps of using Stainless. 
The integration process of the Stainless framework into a Scala project is described, and some aspects of language compatibility are visited in detail.

In chapter 3 the principle and process of transaction creation are demonstrated with Bitcoin-S.

In chapter 4 the correctness of transaction verification in Bitcoin-S is examined. 
The difficulties emerged during the integration of Bitcoin-S and Stainless are covered.

Chapter 5 highlights the verification process of coin addition in Bitcoin-S using the Stainless framework.
The challenges encountered and solutions found are described.
